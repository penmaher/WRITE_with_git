Q. What happens if an author continues to work on a file but I advanced the revision and their branch has conflicts?
A. The short answer is that you will have conflicts between the revisions. This is annoying and will be time consuming to fix. The manager of the project has to fix it. Ask the author to make no further changes and push their changes. I have not tested this idea as yet but here s conceptually what I would do. If they can not push their changes because of merge conflicts then you need manage their branch for them. To do this revert their branch to the last commit the author made. Please make your you understand what you are doing before executing any of these codes as you may have undesirable effects. To move your branch back: git reset -hard HEAD~n where n is the number of commits behind the head you want to checkout.  When the head has moved back push the branch. Then ask the author to push their changes. Which should occur without conflict. Now you can either manually merge the new revision and their updated (but older revision) or you can run the software again to merge it for you. I recommend a manual merge using meld, see http://meldmerge.org/
