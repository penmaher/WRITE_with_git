#----Read me for user_config.sh -----

#In the .bashrc (or equivalent) set up the environment variable called $user_path 
#$git_path is the path to where you're writing the article or in this case testing. 
#$editing_path is a folder within the $git_path directory that is used to merge changes from each of the authors.
#$tex_name this is the name of the file that you're writing. In this case it's article.tex
#$author_list is all the authors on the project, in this case two, each of which has a branch they work from.
#Within the test_latex_git_track_changes repo there are two author branches called test_penny and test_steve. The $branch_prefix is setting the syntax for these branches.
