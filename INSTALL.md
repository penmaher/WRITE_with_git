# Install instructions:

1. This package relies on latexdiff which can be downloaded from [http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/support/latexdiff]

2. Fork this repo (WRITE_with_git) to your local machine.

4. In the root directory for your paper, create a symbolic link called *track_changes* that points to the root directory of WRITE_with_git. eg: 
 `ln -s $path_to_repo/WRITE_with_git/ track_changes`

5. The next step is setting up the *user_config.sh* file. An example *user_config.sh* is provided in this repo as *user_config_example.sh*. Copy *user_config_example.sh* to the root directory of your paper and rename it *user_config.sh*. This should be updated with the information specific to your paper project.

6. From within the root directory for your paper run the script ./track_changes/set_author_info_color.sh This will auto-generate three files based upon the information provided in *user_config.sh*:
  a) *author_colors.tex*
  b) *color_change.tex*
  c) *author_info.tex*
  These files are needed to set up and define each authors colours, set up to do note properties, etc.

# To experiment on a testing environment

1. Follow steps 1. and 2. above.

3. Fork the testing environment repo (testing_WRITE_with_git) to your local machine. 

4. Within the testing_WRITE_with_git root directory create a symbolic link called *track_changes* that points to the root directory of WRITE_with_git. eg: 
 `ln -s $path_to_repo/WRITE_with_git/ track_changes`

5. Modify the *user_config.sh* file which is located in testing_WRITE_with_git. Open the *user_config.sh* file for documentation.

6. From within testing_WRITE_with_git run the script ./track_changes/set_author_info_color.sh This will auto-generate three files:
  a) *author_colors.tex*
  b) *color_change.tex*
  c) *author_info.tex*
